            <h2><u>Alting</u></h2>
            <p>On Discord having an “alt” refers to having an additional account that is separate from one’s main account usually used for spying. Or to skirt anti-dual clanning policies. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2><u>Alliances</u></h2>
            <p>Clans with a specific treaty mutually agreed upon outline the terms of their allegiance. This often includes an attempt by the higher-ups of both clans to force their members to be friendly to the other clan during games. The two best ways this is seen is either through throwing games to the allied clan or during a war where both clans will side with one another.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2><u>BetterTT</u></h2>
            <p>This is a common mod used in the territorial community, allowing for advantages like hovering over players to see their troop count, most importantly, finding people within the game more easily. One of the features many clans use to detect cheating and how a particular game went is being able to tell all the actions someone did in the game. It has helped expose many boosting and multi’ing clans and individuals. Finally, it’s used for hosting custom lobbies. <a href="https://platz1de.github.io/BetterTT/">Link</a></p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2><u>Boat Donating</u></h2>
            <p>This is an old workaround within the community to skirt early-game taxes on donating by spawning near teammates and launching boats into them. The Creator has fixed this by applying taxes to boats now as well and so the tactic is now defunct.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2><u>Boosting</u></h2>
            <p>When coordinated team donations are done to create an unstoppable force early in the game to subsequently steamroll the rest of the map. 
                Although still done, it has become largely defunct due to high taxes on  
                donations in the early game.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2><u>Crown/Contest Games</u></h2>
            <p>Games that occur at XX:00, XX:15, and XX:45 every hour, these games are given extra time for people to join and have double the points awarded. The biggest clans are often seen here, along with grinds hosted around them.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2><u>Dual Clanning</u></h2>
            <p>Playing for more than one clan usually comes with restrictions on what you can do in those clans; sometimes even outright banned.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2><u>Dummy Accounting</u></h2>
            <p>Sometimes after being repeatedly sniped, a person instead of changing their name might join a game with two accounts. This way if one is sniped, it can be ignored and the other can play the game freely.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2><u>Efficient Donating</u></h2>
            <p>Donating is an important part of the game, but unless you are about to die or are aiming to boost, donating all your troops is not wise! Instead, donate around 15-20% every time you hit red interest to donate the most troops efficiently over the long term.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2><u>Friendships</u></h2>
            <p>These are clans that have a general friendship with one another. Although nothing is set down in stone, both clans might share members, and subsequently, both clans’ members will help each other organically. Typically clans must be friends before they can be allies, so if you wish, you could think of this as a “trial alliance.”</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2><u>Fulldonating</u></h2>
            <p>Unlike boosting you have decided to play the game, however at one point in the game it is likely you will die. Instead of letting all your troops go to waste by defending land that is already lost, you can donate them all to an ally to hopefully gain an advantage elsewhere.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2><u>Fullsending</u></h2>
            <p>Attacking someone with all your resources, in an attempt to greatly 
                harm that person, and sometimes letting someone else easily take
                your land.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2><u>Leading an Attack</u></h2>
            <p>Oftentimes you will find yourself in a position where many people are hesitant to use their resources to attack another. Sometimes leading to stalemates, other times losing opportunities to defeat an opponent. To break this stalemate, one might attempt to “lead the attack” by attacking first, thereby encouraging others to follow suit. It will often break the stalemate but might lead the attacked party to fullsend you.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2><u>Super Clans</u></h2>
            <p>Clans that are above 10 points are considered “Super Clans,” Usually ranging from 1-3 clans. To reach this amount of points means your clan is so pervasive in the game, that the vast majority of contests, and side games will have this clan in it; and winning them regularly. Not only this, but it is very hard to maintain this level of dominance by being active in only one time period. Clans here will have some level of activity throughout all 24 hours of the day.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2><u>Major Clans</u></h2>
            <p>Clans within the top 20 are widely considered “Major clans”; they are the ones that warrant news articles and are talked most about. You would be hard-pressed to find a Major clan allied to many non-major clans. Entering this exclusive top 20 provides benefits in the community server and drives recruitment.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2><u>Merging</u></h2>
            <p>Sometimes in a game you might think your position is untenable, long term. However if someone is low on troops near you, you can full donate to your ally and let this other person take you over. Subsequently this person already low on troops would overextend, allowing your ally to sweep in. Thereby not only gaining all of your troops from the donation, but also all of your land and more. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2><u>Minor Clans</u></h2>
            <p>Clans that have over 0.1 points are considered “Minor clans”; they are clans that have not reached a point where they can have an impact on the mainstream territorial community. However, these clans should not be overlooked because they are well on their way to doing so. In times of war, “Major clans” have been known to turn towards them to bolster their cause. Additionally, these clans are prime targets for mergers.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2><u>Micro Clans</u></h2>
            <p>Clans under 0.1 are considered “Micro clans.”; essentially having zero effect on the territorial community and mostly ignored. Due to the mechanics of territorial itself, winning a single game would let you join the thousands of other clans in this category. No known active coordinated clans are within this category, and it is exclusively filled with randoms.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2><u>YouTuber Clans</u></h2>
            <p>YouTuber clans are used by players to indicate they are a fan of the corresponding Territorial.io YouTuber. They are characterized by spikes in points during streams, followed by periods of decline. These clans are primarily created by and for fans of the Territorial.io YouTuber; the YouTuber is generally not in them with a few exceptions, like Tokyo YT. Examples:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>[CORGI]</li>
                <li>[DREW]</li>
                <li>[TOKYO]</li>
                <li>[Zii]</li>
                <li>[CG]</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2><u>Country clans</u></h2>
            <p>Country clans are used by players to indicate origin from or support for the corresponding region. Examples:            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>TR</b>: Türkiye </li>
                <li><b>FR</b>: République Française</li>

                <li><b>RU</b>: Российская Федерация</li> 
                <li><b>UZB</b>: Ўзбекистон Республикаси</li> 
                <li><b>NL</b>: Nederland</li> 
                <li><b>BR</b>: República Federativa do Brasil</li> 
                <li><b>LT</b>: Lietuvos Respublika</li> 
                <li><b>CZ</b>: Česká Republika</li> 
                <li><b>ITA</b>: Repubblica Italiana</li> 
                <li><b>SRB</b>: Република Србија</li> 
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2><u>Meme Clans</u></h2>
            <p>Meme clans are self-explanatory. Examples:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>[BOT]</li>
                <li>[DIE]</li>
                <li>[420]</li>
                <li>[SOYJACKS]</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2><u>Mirror Accounting</u></h2>
            <p>Joining your same game with a different tab to increase the total amount of potential points and either ignoring or closing the tab once the game begins. It best works in a group grind to make smaller maps worth it.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2><u>Multi-Accounting</u></h2>
            <p>When you get multiple accounts within the same game and use them to gain an advantage in-game by boosting yourself or an ally.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2><u>Nuke</u></h2>
            <p>Many clans are run through Discord; unfortunately, sometimes all of their members are banned/kicked by a rogue Mod; this is a Nuke. A Half-Nuke is when roles and channels are deleted, but members are not kicked or banned.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2><u>Peace-Sniping</u></h2>
            <p>This is when you wait for a portion of the enemy teams to agree to peace to end the game. Once this has gotten to a sufficient level where your agreement would end the game, you full-send into the enemy. Then quickly agreeing to the peace, winning you the game.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2><u>Pseudo-National Clans</u></h2>
            <p>These are clans that rely on a popular cultural element that is easily recognizable for a specific nation(s), without expressly identifying with said nation. This is usually done in an attempt to broaden its appeal. ie; “VIKING” for the Nordic countries. “SPQR” for Italy & Greece</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2><u>Racing</u></h2>
            <p>When dealing with the leader in the game, you have two options, either fight or attempt to out pace them. This is called racing, alternatively it could happen when you need to outrace a teammate to ensure you can cut them off.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2><u>Random Spawning</u></h2>
            <p>In the beginning of a game you can choose where to spawn, however if you do not you will be random spawned by the game. Oftentimes in undesirable spots, resulting in a likely loss.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2><u>Replays</u></h2>
            <p>The Creator added an in game functionality to get a replay of a game, simply wait until the game has ended. Go to the bottom right where you would exit and click “Replay”. You can either copy and paste this for later, or launch the replay immediately.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2><u>Sanctioning</u></h2>
            <p>When a clan declares that another clan cannot receive help in-game from their clan members, it usually includes preventing their members from dual clanning with this clan.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2><u>Shadow Accounting</u></h2>
            <p>With a much more ominous name than Mirror Accounting, the same strategy is used more deviously. Usually accompanied by bots, a person will have a bunch of accounts join with a singular tag of a clan they do not want to win the game. This reduces the amount of actual members within a team, thereby making it weaker.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2><u>Side Games</u></h2>
            <p>This is a term commonly used throughout the territorial community used to describe team games that are not contests. Usually during a grind most clans will join a contest, so these games are used as something to pass the time in between them.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2><u>Sniping</u></h2>
            <p>Sometimes when clans are at war, or two individuals are otherwise at odds with each other, one might try to find out what maps the clan or individual is joining and spawn near them to hamper their expansion or even destroy them early in the game.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2><u>Stalemate</u></h2>
            <p>When there are three major players left, a stalemate option will appear, if ⅔ players agree to it, no one will win. It’s rare but it ensures at the end game that everyone keeps attacking to avoid the stalemate.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2><u>Telejo, CG, Greenbiscuit, Vkij, etc Openings</u></h2>
            <p>These are specific openings with set percentages at specific ticks in a cycle that are ideal for expansion</p>
        </div>
        <h1>Technical Definitions</h1>
        <p>The following definitions are very technical, only the most experienced territorial players commonly use them. To have an easier time understanding them they’ll all be placed together.</p>
        <div class="section">
            <h2><u>IFS: InFoSend</u></h2>
            <p>Ticks when attack commands can be executed in multiplayer</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2><u>AU: Attack Update </u></h2>
            <p>Tick when a layer of land can be taken.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2><u>CAUT: Closest AU Tick  </u></h2>
            <p>The tick when the next AU will occur.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2><u>AUDiffs: Attack Update Differences </u></h2>
            <p>The number of AU ticks between the current IFS and the next IFS.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2><u>PIAI: Pre-Interest Attack Initialization  </u></h2>
            <p>We initialize an attack with minimum troops here (~3). At the next AU during the next IFS, we will reinforce the bulk of the troops, if we can gain interest between the PIIT (Pre-Interest Initial Tick) and the next AU.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2><u>AFAU: Abort Final Attack Update  </u></h2>
            <p>If this is enabled, the last attack update will be removed and the attack will end prematurely before the cycle ends.</p>
        </div>
